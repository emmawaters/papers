#Authors
Gerard Capes
John Smith

#Introduction
Burning aerosols is bad. Don't do it. Just don't.
Waters and Hartley (2020) looked at the halogens.

#Simulations
John's atmospheric box model showed the change in size distribution was 
dominated by coagulation rather than condensation.

# Results
Success!
